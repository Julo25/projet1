<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>As part of my web development studies, I chose to build a web page from www.lespetitsdebrouillards.org. Les Petits Debrouillards is an 
association that promotes science and technology to children and young people. I chose this page because it contains many interesting elements such as images, 
videos, text sections, etc.</p>
